# D047 SupportedHe160MCS blocker

## Status

- case: `D047 SupportedHe160MCS`
- workbook row: `47`
- current state: **blocked as workbook/source authority conflict** (freshly revalidated via official rerun `20260415T182628238198`)
- next blocker-review target: `D179 Radio.Ampdu` (there is currently no clean workbook-pass-ready single case left in the compare-open set)

## Why this is blocked

`compare-0401` is correctly treating workbook row `47` as open because the loader reads answer columns `R/S/T` (`src/testpilot/reporting/wifi_llapi_compare_0401.py:135-149`), and row `47` currently resolves to `Pass / Pass / Not Supported`.

However, the same workbook row also contains conflicting evidence that matches the live 0403 runtime:

- legacy workbook columns `I/J/K` read `Not Support / Not Support / Not Support`
- workbook note `V47` explicitly says pWHM does **not** support standalone `SupportedHe160MCS` and only defines:
  - `RxSupportedHe160MCS`
  - `TxSupportedHe160MCS`
  - `RxSupportedHeMCS`
  - `TxSupportedHeMCS`

That row-level note matches the current 0403 source/runtime split for `WiFi.AccessPoint.{i}.AssociatedDevice.{i}.`.

## Workbook evidence

- `0401.xlsx` row `47`
  - object/api: `WiFi.AccessPoint.{i}.AssociatedDevice.{i}.` / `SupportedHe160MCS`
  - workbook command seed (`D47`): `ubus-cli WiFi.AccessPoint.{i}.AssociatedDevice.{i}.SupportedHe160MCS=`
  - answer columns `R/S/T`: `Pass / Pass / Not Supported`
  - legacy columns `I/J/K`: `Not Support / Not Support / Not Support`
  - note `V47`: standalone `SupportedHe160MCS` is not supported by pWHM; only Rx/Tx sibling fields exist

## 0403 source/runtime evidence

### Installed ODL split

- `targets/BGW720-300/fs.install/etc/amx/wld/wld_accesspoint.odl:L1605-L1616`
  - `AssociatedDevice` exposes only:
    - `RxSupportedHe160MCS`
    - `TxSupportedHe160MCS`
- `targets/BGW720-300/fs.install/etc/amx/wld/wld_endpoint.odl:L371-L377`
  - standalone `SupportedHe160MCS` exists under the endpoint model, not the access-point associated-device model

### Official rerun evidence

- official rerun: `20260412T235952361188`
- DUT log: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/20260412T235952361188_DUT.log:L84-L109`
  - `SupportedHe160MCS?` returns `error=4` / `message=parameter not found`
  - same `AssociatedDevice.1` entry still exposes:
    - `DriverRxSupportedHe160MCS=11,11,11,11`
    - `DriverTxSupportedHe160MCS=11,11,11,11`
- DUT log: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/20260412T235952361188_DUT.log:L62-L70`
  - same station MAC resolves as `2C:59:17:00:04:85`
- STA log: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/20260412T235952361188_STA.log:L82-L99`
  - STA is stably connected to `testpilot5G`
- trace JSON: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/agent_trace/20260412T235952361188/wifi-llapi-D047-supportedhe160mcs.json`
  - `evaluation_verdict=Pass`
  - live case logic exact-closes the not-supported getter plus sibling-field evidence
- fresh official rerun: `20260415T182628238198`
  - markdown report: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/bgw720-b0-403_wifi_llapi_20260415t182628238198.md:L9-L11,L31-L47`
    - `result_5g/result_6g/result_24g = Not Supported / N/A / N/A`
    - `diagnostic_status=Pass`
    - same run again exact-closes:
      - `SupportedHe160MCS? -> error=4 / message=parameter not found`
      - `DriverRxSupportedHe160MCS=11,11,11,11`
      - `DriverTxSupportedHe160MCS=11,11,11,11`
      - `DriverHeCapsPresent=1`
  - DUT log: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/20260415T182628238198_DUT.log:L86-L109`
    - standalone getter still returns `parameter not found`, while sibling Rx/Tx fields remain populated
  - STA log: `plugins/wifi_llapi/reports/20260415T182628238198_STA.log:L84-L94`
    - STA remains stably connected to `testpilot5G`
  - compare overlay: `compare-0401.md:L208,L255-L272`
    - actual raw still resolves to `Not Supported / N/A / N/A`
    - workbook expected raw still resolves to `Pass / Pass / Not Supported`

## Why the YAML is not being rewritten

The current YAML is source/runtime-correct for `WiFi.AccessPoint.{i}.AssociatedDevice.{i}.SupportedHe160MCS`: the standalone field is not exposed on the AssociatedDevice object in current 0403, while the sibling Rx/Tx fields are.

Rewriting `results_reference` back to workbook `Pass / Pass / Not Supported` would invent support for an AssociatedDevice field that current 0403 does not expose and that the rerun explicitly reports as `parameter not found`.

## Required follow-up

Before D047 can be closed, one of these authority questions must be resolved:

1. confirm workbook row `47` answer columns `R/S/T` are wrong and should be corrected to the row note / source/runtime shape, or
2. confirm the row should have targeted a different object family (for example endpoint rather than access-point associated-device), then remap the case accordingly.

Until that authority conflict is resolved, keep D047 in the blocker bucket and do not rewrite the current YAML to workbook-pass semantics.
