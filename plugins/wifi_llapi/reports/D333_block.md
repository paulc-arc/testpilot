## Workbook-style replay result

The committed workbook-era case compares:

1. `WiFi.SSID.{i}.Stats.PacketsSent?`
2. `WiFi.SSID.{i}.getSSIDStats()`
3. `/proc/net/dev_extstats` field `$11`

Run `20260411T194816992700` proved that shape is no longer durable on 0403.

### Attempt 1

- 5G: `direct=293096`, stale `getSSIDStats` extractor last-match=`26411`, `/proc $11=293096`
- 6G: `183455`, stale last-match=`21266`, `/proc $11=279090`
- 2.4G: `295603`, stale last-match=`8061`, `/proc $11=292424`

### Attempt 2

- 5G: `293282`, stale last-match=`26413`, `/proc $11=293282`
- 6G: `183535`, stale last-match=`21271`, `/proc $11=279270`
- 2.4G: `295898`, stale last-match=`8216`, `/proc $11=292614`

So the old case has two separate problems:

1. the loose `getSSIDStats()` extractor overmatches unrelated `*PacketsSent` fields and keeps the wrong last value
2. `/proc/net/dev_extstats` `$11` is not the authoritative all-band driver path on 0403

## Source-backed trial result

Active 0403 source should be close to the already aligned `D312 getSSIDStats() PacketsSent` family:

- base path from `wl if_counters txframe`
- optional `wds*` accumulation for matching peers

So a trial rewrite used:

- anchored `getSSIDStats()` extraction: `^[[:space:]]*PacketsSent = ...`
- driver formula: `wl if_counters txframe + matching wds txframe`

Run `20260411T195140855058`:

### Attempt 1

- 5G: `direct / getSSIDStats / formula = 293527 / 293527 / 293532`
- 6G: `183663 / 183663 / 183663`
- 2.4G: `296276 / 296276 / 296276`

### Attempt 2

- 5G: `293669 / 293669 / 293674`
- 6G: `183687 / 183687 / 183687`
- 2.4G: `296503 / 296503 / 296503`

The anchored extractor fixed the bogus `getSSIDStats()` mismatch, and 6G/2.4G exact-closed, but 5G still held a stable `driver = direct + 5` drift on both attempts.

### Superseding official rerun — same source-backed rewrite still fails in the real runner path

Official rerun `20260411T235643720137` retried the same anchored extractor plus `txframe + matching wds txframe` formula after a temporary local rewrite:

- attempt 1
  - 5G: `direct / getSSIDStats / formula = 319230 / 319235 / 319235`
  - 6G: `207464 / 207466 / 207466`
  - 2.4G: `325162 / 325162 / 325164`
- attempt 2
  - 5G: `319376 / 319376 / 319381`
  - 6G: `207490 / 207490 / 207490`
  - 2.4G: `325389 / 325389 / 325391`

This re-proved that the 5G runner-path drift is still the same fixed `+5`, while 6G/2.4G are also not fully durable across all attempts.

### Post-`verify_env` settle retrial — fixed `+5` narrows, but does not close

Official rerun `20260412T004816450100` retried the same anchored extractor plus `txframe + matching wds txframe` formula again, but inserted the same short settle (`sleep 2`) that resolved `D322`:

- attempt 1
  - 5G: `direct / getSSIDStats / formula = 324804 / 324804 / 324805`
  - 6G: `212209 / 212209 / 212209`
  - 2.4G: `333730 / 333730 / 333730`
- attempt 2
  - 5G: `324947 / 324947 / 324947`
  - 6G: `212232 / 212232 / 212234`
  - 2.4G: `333958 / 333958 / 333958`

This materially narrowed the earlier fixed-`+5` 5G blocker, but it still did not produce a deterministic all-band official replay:

- attempt 1 now failed only on 5G, and only by `+1`
- attempt 2 exact-closed 5G/2.4G, but 6G still failed by `+2`

So the short settle helps, but it still does **not** make the real runner path durable enough to commit.

Focused DUT-only probes still exact-close the same formula outside the full runner path (`2415/2415/2415`, `1058/1058/1058`, `734/734/734` on 5G/6G/2.4G with no active `wds*` peer), so the official runner remains the acceptance authority.

## Resolution

Clean-start official rerun `20260412T054702963914` resolved the remaining acceptance-path blocker once the shared 6G baseline hot path was hardened further:

1. `verify_env` now accepts a driver `assoclist` fallback when public `AssociatedDevice.*` is transiently empty
2. `_apply_6g_ocv_fix()` now accepts the already-patched pre-restart `ocv=0` state when post-restart file probes briefly drop it, as long as the restarted hostapd process/BSS survive
3. the generic 6G connect settle window now waits `sleep 15` before the first verify pass

With those shared fixes in place, the same source-backed snapshot rewrite exact-closed on attempt 1:

- 5G: `direct / getSSIDStats / formula = 461 / 461 / 461`
- 6G: `592 / 592 / 592`
- 2.4G: `707 / 707 / 707`

So the earlier `+5`, then `+1`, then `+2` residuals were not an authority problem in the `txframe + matching wds txframe` formula itself; they were still shared baseline / runner-path noise before the snapshot steps ran.

## Current decision

`D333` is now **aligned**.

- keep the committed YAML on the anchored `PacketsSent` extractor plus `wl if_counters txframe + matching wds txframe` snapshot rewrite
- keep workbook row metadata at `333`
- keep `results_reference.v4.0.3` at `Pass / Pass / Pass`
- retain this file only as historical trial and resolution evidence

## Next direction

1. Move the next open-set direct-stats revisit to `D324`.
2. Keep `D281` / `D282` / `D295` / `D324` as the remaining open blockers until each one has a deterministic source-backed official rerun.
